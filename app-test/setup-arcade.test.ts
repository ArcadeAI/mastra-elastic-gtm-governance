/**
 * `bun run setup-arcade <host>` against a stand-in for Arcade's admin API (#9, #30, #48).
 *
 * Never the real API, never the real Arcade CLI, never the real `~/.arcade`.
 *
 * - **The stand-in** answers the routes `scripts/setup-arcade/arcade.ts`
 *   sends, each with the method the official client uses where one exists,
 *   keeps what it is sent, and records every request, so each test can say
 *   exactly what reached "Arcade". **Anything else gets the 404 Arcade itself
 *   answers** for a route or method it does not serve, byte for byte: until #26
 *   this stand-in served `POST /v1/admin/secrets/{key}` because the pinned spec
 *   says POST, and the first live run got that 404 instead. Since #30 it serves
 *   the plugins, hooks and gateways under one org and project, as the live
 *   swagger has them, and still 404s the bare `/v1/plugins` the second live run
 *   was refused. Since #48 it serves only the gateway list: this script never
 *   writes a gateway, and a test puts one there the way the dashboard would.
 * - **The Arcade CLI** is a shell script first on `PATH` that records where it
 *   was run and with what, so `arcade deploy` is observed and never performed.
 * - **The CLI's context** is a `credentials.yaml` in a throwaway `HOME`, in the
 *   shape `arcade_core.config_model.Config` writes, holding fake tokens that
 *   must never be printed.
 *
 * Each test runs the real script in a throwaway project of its own: a git
 * repository whose `.env` is the repo's `.env.example` copied verbatim with only
 * `ARCADE_API_KEY` filled, which is where a developer stands after the
 * Quickstart's `cp .env.example .env`.
