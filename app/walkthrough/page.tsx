/**
 * The four acts, as five of the outreach library's artifacts with one line
 * each. Forked with the library's `fork-artifact` skill; the provenance header
 * on every file under `components/artifacts/` names the commit.
 *
 * The artifacts argue the mechanism — Stripe refunds, customer PII — and the
 * captions say what the same mechanism does to the deal desk. Relabelling the
 * artifacts themselves is legitimate (a fork is a detached copy) and is left
 * for whoever presents; the mechanism is the point on stage.
 *
 * Brand tokens are the library's, written as literals because this page loads
 * no CSS of the library's: `bg` black, `ink` for the one heading line, `body`
 * and `muted` for copy, `arcade` chartreuse for the kicker. Serif for the one
 * large line, per the brand skill.
