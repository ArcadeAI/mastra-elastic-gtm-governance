/**
 * The four buttons on the sign-in panel, and the role and authority each of
 * them carries.
 *
 * **No emails and no passwords.** That is the point of #82's slice: the persona
 * a button names is a request to start a sign-in, and the identity that comes
 * back is whatever `apps/idp` asserts about whoever typed a password. If this
 * list carried emails, the temptation would be to trust one, and
 * `context.user_id` would become a value the browser chose. The addresses live
 * in the shared role email contract and are read in `roster.ts`, which resolves a label
 * *from* an email the IdP already asserted and never the other way round.
 *
 * The cast is `DESIGN.md`'s. It is a demo fixture in the same category as the
 * IdP itself: a forker deletes both and points at their own directory.
 *
 * ## Not the roster
 *
 * Since #32 nothing on screen reads a name, a role or a clearance from this
 * list. The card beside a signed-in person reads `governance.db`'s `subjects`
 * row through the control plane (`roster.ts`), because a user added with
 * `bun run users` is not in this list and a clearance raised live is not in it
 * either. What stays here is the sign-in hint's key and the words each demo
 * role reads as, `ROLE_LABELS`.
 *
 * The figures are still the fixture's, and `app-test/persona-roster.test.ts`
 * still reads `gate/policies/governance.json` and fails if the
 * two ever disagree, so the cast written down here is the cast that seeds.
