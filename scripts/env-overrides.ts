/**
 * The app's `.env` files, and the shell variables that beat them (#54).
 *
 * A real environment variable wins over `.env` for every process this repo
 * starts: Bun's own precedence for `bun run dev` (`scripts/next.ts`), Mastra's
 * for `bun run studio` (`mastra dev` never overrides a variable it inherited),
 * and Next's under both. That is right for a host that injects its
 * configuration, and it is a trap on a laptop. On the #52 live test the
 * human's terminal still exported an older clone's `.env`: `bun run dev` ran on
 * that clone's `IDP_CLIENT_ID`, sign-in failed with `invalid_client`, and the
 * same stale `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` encrypted `idp.db`'s signing key, so the next
 * clean boot refused it. Nothing said the shell was involved.
 *
 * So each of those commands names, on start, every identity or secret key the
 * shell sets to a value other than the one the `.env` files give, and says the
 * shell's value wins.
 * Names only, never a value: the warning goes to a terminal, and the values
 * are secrets. `bun run setup-arcade` goes further and refuses to run
 * (`shellConflicts` in `scripts/setup-arcade/env-file.ts`), because it decides
 * what to register from `.env` alone.
 *
 * The launchers call it, `scripts/next.ts` and `scripts/studio.ts`, before the
 * app or Studio starts, and never the app itself: comparing `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`
 * means reading it, and no app source outside the identity provider does
 * (DESIGN.md → "What the chat withholds";
 * `app-test/identity/only-identity-mints.test.ts`). `scripts/` is not in the image.

 * different are asked again one at a time. The second ask is what keeps
 * `IDP_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URIS_WEB=https://${APP_PUBLIC_HOST}/…` out of the
 * warning when only APP_PUBLIC_HOST is the shell's: with both dropped the
 * redirect expands from the file's host, and with only itself dropped, from
