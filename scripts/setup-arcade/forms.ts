/**
 * What `bun run setup-arcade` prints for the registrations it cannot make by
 * API (#9, #28, #30, #48), which since #52 is the fallback of the one-click
 * path through the Coordinator API.
 *
 * - **The User Source** (hop 1), when the run fell back before it was
 *   registered. The fields are the ones docs.arcade.dev lists under "Operate →
 *   Identity → User Sources": Name, Description, Issuer URL, Client ID, Client
 *   Secret, and under Advanced, Scopes and Subject Claim.
 * - **The gateway**, whenever the run fell back, or the User Source was
 *   registered and the gateway create failed. It authenticates through the
 *   User Source, so the developer creates it in the dashboard, right after the
 *   User Source and while the hooks are still disabled: active hooks filter the
 *   tool list the gateway form shows.
 *   Its fields are from docs.arcade.dev "MCP Gateways → Create via dashboard",
 *   under a slug this script picks and writes as `ARCADE_GATEWAY_ID`.
 * - **The contextual access hooks**, only when the run found no Arcade org and
 *   project to register them in (`context.ts`). With one, they go through the
 *   API (`arcade.ts`, #30). The hooks form carries the live swagger's field
 *   names (`schemas.CreatePluginRequest`, its `webhook_config`, and
 *   `schemas.CreateHookRequest`'s `hook_point`), because nobody has read the
 *   dashboard's own labels yet.
