/**
 * `bun run setup-arcade <ngrok-host> [--dry-run] [--skip-deploy] [--redeploy] [--gateway <slug>]` (#9, #30, #48, #52)
 *
 * Everything the Arcade side of this template needs, from one command, after
 * the developer has filled in the few required values in `.env`
 * (`ARCADE_API_KEY` among them). In order:
 *
 * 1. **Refuses** to go on if `.env` is tracked by git or not gitignored: this
 *    command writes secrets into it.
 * 2. **Resolves the Arcade org and project** (`setup-arcade/context.ts`):
 *    `ARCADE_ORG_ID` and `ARCADE_PROJECT_ID`, else the Arcade CLI's active
 *    context. Then, before anything is written, **one read-only call** under
 *    them with the key, `GET …/plugins`: a 401, 403 or 404 means the key and
 *    the resolved project disagree, and the run stops (#30).
 * 3. **Reads** the hop-2 provider `app-identity` back from Arcade. It is
 *    create-only (DESIGN.md → "Arcade config is read-only"): if it exists and
 *    differs from what this app needs, the differences are printed and the run
 *    stops, having written nothing.
 * 4. **Mints** the app's three OAuth clients in `idp.db`: `arcade` (hop 2),
 *    `arcade-user-source` (hop 1) and `web` (the app's own sign-in).
 * 5. **Fills in `.env`**, blanks only, never overwriting: `APP_PUBLIC_HOST`,
 *    `SESSION_SECRET`, `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, `ARCADE_HOOK_SIGNING_SECRET`, `APPROVALS_STORE_TOKEN`,
 *    `IDP_OAUTH_CLIENTS` and the clients' redirect URIs, `IDP_CLIENT_ID` and
 *    `IDP_CLIENT_SECRET`, `ARCADE_GATEWAY_ID` and `GOVERNANCE_STREAM=hooks`.
 *    One exception (#54): an `IDP_CLIENT_ID` that is not `idp.db`'s web client,
 *    as after `idp.db` was deleted, is rewritten with its secret, before step 3's
 *    comparison can stop the run. That client is the app's own sign-in, and
 *    nothing in Arcade holds it.
 * 6. **Registers by API**: the provider, the tool secrets `APP_PUBLIC_HOST`
 *    and `APPROVALS_STORE_TOKEN`, the custom verifier, and the contextual
 *    access hooks (#30), each read back. The hooks are created **disabled**
 *    (#48), because active hooks filter the tool list the dashboard's gateway
 *    form shows.
 * 7. **Deploys the toolkits**: one `arcade deploy`, in `mcp`, which
 *    carries Deals, Approvals and Elasticsearch, streaming its output and
 *    stopping on a failure (#30). A toolkit Arcade already runs is skipped: `GET …/workers/<name>`,
 *    the CLI's own check, answers 404 when it is missing. `--redeploy`
 *    deploys it anyway, and `--skip-deploy` leaves both to the developer.
 * 8. **Registers the User Source and the gateway by API, then turns the hooks
 *    on** (#52), the one-click path, through the Coordinator API
 *    (`setup-arcade/coordinator.ts`, `ARCADE_COORDINATOR_URL`, default
 *    `https://cloud.arcade.dev/api`, never experience.arcade.dev):
 *    - The project's User Sources are listed. One whose issuer is the app's
 *      origin, or whose client is the app's `arcade-user-source`, is held to
 *      the issuer, the client id, the `email` subject claim and the scopes: it
 *      matches and is used, or it differs and the run stops (exit 1), naming
 *      each difference, with no gateway and the hooks as they were.
 *    - With none, the run waits, on a terminal only, for the developer to
 *      start `bun run dev` and the tunnel. On Enter it reads the issuer from
 *      the app's `/.well-known/openid-configuration` through it, byte for
 *      byte, and has Arcade check that issuer (`POST …/user_sources/test_issuer`,
 *      which saves nothing). A failure of either, a 422 from Arcade with its
 *      reason, asks again. Then it creates the User Source, the
 *      `arcade-user-source` secret rotated unless this run minted it.
 *    - The User Source, found or created, is read back by id: active, and
 *      this app's, or the run stops as for one that differs.
 *    - The gateway is created through it (`POST …/gateways`, the six tools,
 *      `auth_type` `user_source`) and read back; one already under the slug is
 *      held to that User Source, never edited. Then the hooks are `PATCH`ed to
 *      `active` and read back, last. A User Source registered with the gateway
 *      not is said plainly, with the gateway form and the rerun that finishes.
 *    - **The fallback** (#48): a Coordinator call that fails, or answers a
 *      shape this script does not expect (a 401 or a 404 is said to be the
 *      key or the project), an issuer check this Coordinator does not have,
 *      `n` or Ctrl-C at the wait, or stdin that is not a terminal prints one
 *      line naming which, then the #48 flow,
 *      unchanged: `GET …/gateways`, never written, under the slug the gateway
 *      form names. Not there (the first run): the hooks stay disabled, and the
 *      run ends on the User Source form, then the gateway form, then the
 *      command for the second run, and a warning that the gateway runs
 *      ungoverned until that second run. There (the second run): the hooks
 *      are turned on and read back, and a read-back that does not say
 *      `active` fails the run. A gateway whose `auth_type` is not the User
 *      Source stops the run with the hooks as they were; a tool list that is
 *      not the six is printed as warnings, and the hooks are turned on anyway
 *      (the human's call on #48).
 *
 * The same command is every run: what Arcade already holds tells them apart,
 * and a rerun of a finished project is a no-op that says so. Rerunning after a
 * failure never turns the hooks on ahead of the gateway.
 *
 * With no org and project to be found, the hooks and the gateway are printed as
 * the dashboard forms they were before #30, and the run says why.
 *
 * `--dry-run` writes nothing and sends nothing: it prints every request a real
 * run would make from the state on disk, in order, with the key and every
 * secret as a placeholder. Sending nothing, it cannot ask Arcade whether the
 * provider exists, so it infers it: `.env`'s `IDP_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URIS_ARCADE`
 * holds the callback Arcade returns when it creates the provider, and `idp.db`
 * holds the clients (#28). Which registration goes which way, and the spec
 * path of each call, is in `scripts/setup-arcade/arcade.ts`.
 * `app-test/setup-arcade.test.ts` runs this against a local stand-in, with the
 * Arcade CLI faked on `PATH` and its context faked in a throwaway `HOME`. Its
 * first run against the real API (#7) stopped at the tool secrets, sent as
 * POST; they are PUT since #26. The second stopped at `GET /v1/plugins`; the
 * hooks are registered under the project since #30. A rerun picks up from
 * either state.
 *
 * Run it with `--no-env-file` (the package script does): it reads `.env` and
 * `.env.local` itself, so it knows which values `.env` holds and which come
 * from elsewhere, and writes only to `.env`.
