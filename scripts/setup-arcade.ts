/**
 * `bun run setup-arcade <ngrok-host> [--dry-run] [--skip-deploy] [--redeploy] [--gateway <slug>]` (#9, #30, #48)
 *
 * Everything the Arcade side of this template needs, from one command, after
 * the developer has filled in the few required values in `.env`
 * (`ARCADE_API_KEY` among them). In order:
 *
 * 1. **Refuses** to go on if `.env` is tracked by git or not gitignored: this
 *    command writes secrets into it.
 * 2. **Resolves the Arcade org and project** (`setup-arcade/context.ts`):
 *    `ARCADE_ORG_ID` and `ARCADE_PROJECT_ID`, else the Arcade CLI's active
 *    context. Then, before anything is written, **one read-only call** under
 *    them with the key, `GET …/plugins`: a 401, 403 or 404 means the key and
 *    the resolved project disagree, and the run stops (#30).
 * 3. **Reads** the hop-2 provider `app-identity` back from Arcade. It is
 *    create-only (DESIGN.md → "Arcade config is read-only"): if it exists and
 *    differs from what this app needs, the differences are printed and the run
 *    stops, having written nothing.
 * 4. **Mints** the app's three OAuth clients in `idp.db`: `arcade` (hop 2),
 *    `arcade-user-source` (hop 1) and `web` (the app's own sign-in).
 * 5. **Fills in `.env`**, blanks only, never overwriting: `APP_PUBLIC_HOST`,
 *    `SESSION_SECRET`, `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, `ARCADE_HOOK_SIGNING_SECRET`, `APPROVALS_STORE_TOKEN`,
 *    `IDP_OAUTH_CLIENTS` and the clients' redirect URIs, `IDP_CLIENT_ID` and
 *    `IDP_CLIENT_SECRET`, `ARCADE_GATEWAY_ID` and `GOVERNANCE_STREAM=hooks`.
 * 6. **Registers by API**: the provider, the tool secrets `APP_PUBLIC_HOST`
 *    and `APPROVALS_STORE_TOKEN`, the custom verifier, and the contextual
 *    access hooks (#30), each read back. The hooks are created **disabled**
 *    (#48), because active hooks filter the tool list the dashboard's gateway
 *    form shows.
 * 7. **Deploys both toolkits**: `arcade deploy` in `tools/loan`, then in
 *    `tools/approvals`, streaming their output and stopping on a failure
 *    (#30). A toolkit Arcade already runs is skipped: `GET …/workers/<name>`,
 *    the CLI's own check, answers 404 when it is missing. `--redeploy`
 *    deploys it anyway, and `--skip-deploy` leaves both to the developer.
 * 8. **Looks for the gateway** (#48), `GET …/gateways`, under the slug the
 *    gateway form names. It never creates one: the gateway authenticates
 *    through the User Source, and a project key cannot read a User Source's id.
 *    - **Not there** (the first run): the hooks stay disabled, and the run
 *      ends on the User Source form, then the gateway form, then the command
 *      for the second run, and a warning that the gateway runs ungoverned
 *      until that second run.
 *    - **There** (the second run): the hooks are `PATCH`ed to `active` and read
 *      back, and a read-back that does not say `active` fails the run. Hooks
 *      already active are left, and the run says they are on. A gateway whose
 *      `auth_type` is not the User Source stops the run with the hooks as they
 *      were; a tool list that is not the six is printed as warnings, and the
 *      hooks are turned on anyway (the human's call on #48).
 *
 * The same command is the first run and the second: the gateway's presence is
 * what tells them apart, so rerunning the first one after a failure never
 * turns the hooks on ahead of the gateway form.
 *
 * With no org and project to be found, the hooks and the gateway are printed as
 * the dashboard forms they were before #30, and the run says why.
 *
 * `--dry-run` writes nothing and sends nothing: it prints every request a real
 * run would make from the state on disk, in order, with the key and every
 * secret as a placeholder. Sending nothing, it cannot ask Arcade whether the
 * provider exists, so it infers it: `.env`'s `IDP_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URIS_ARCADE`
 * holds the callback Arcade returns when it creates the provider, and `idp.db`
 * holds the clients (#28). Which registration goes which way, and the spec
 * path of each call, is in `scripts/setup-arcade/arcade.ts`.
 * `app-test/setup-arcade.test.ts` runs this against a local stand-in, with the
 * Arcade CLI faked on `PATH` and its context faked in a throwaway `HOME`. Its
 * first run against the real API (#7) stopped at the tool secrets, sent as
 * POST; they are PUT since #26. The second stopped at `GET /v1/plugins`; the
 * hooks are registered under the project since #30. A rerun picks up from
 * either state.
 *
 * Run it with `--no-env-file` (the package script does): it reads `.env` and
 * `.env.local` itself, so it knows which values `.env` holds and which come
 * from elsewhere, and writes only to `.env`.
