"""`mcp/` is the one `arcade deploy`, and nothing else in the repo leans on it.

Two directions, and both matter:

  * nothing under the app reaches *into* `mcp/`, so it ships with `arcade deploy`
    and never with the app's image or workspaces;
  * nothing in its *runtime* reaches out of it, so it can be lifted into another
    repo whole.

The tests do reach out — they read the cross-language routing cases under
`packages/policy-schema/contract/`, deliberately, because agreement with the
TypeScript router is the thing worth checking.
