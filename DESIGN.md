# Contextual Governance — Mastra × Arcade

A live demo, shipped as a forkable template: an agent that does real work in a real
business system, with Arcade enforcing deterministic control on every tool call.

Source narrative: loan officer asks an agent to approve a $95K loan and "double-check
your work." Four things go wrong. All four are caught by the control plane, not by the
model.

## Thesis

Treat the LLM as an adversary. Controls it cannot reason around must live outside it.
Arcade provides **four** identity-keyed control points on every tool call, and the model
sits inside all of them:

| # | Layer | Keyed on | Mechanism | Act |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Whether you can see the tool | identity | `/access` → `deny` list | 1 |
| 2 | Whether you hold the credential to call it at all | identity | per-tool auth requirement, OAuth scopes | — |
| 3 | Whether you have the authority for *this* call | identity + policy | `/pre` → `CHECK_FAILED` | 2 |
| 4 | What comes back | policy | `/post` → `override.output` | 3, 4 |

Layer 2 was added on #32. It is not a gap in governance — it is a cheaper, earlier gate on
the same identity, and defence in depth is the point. **It has one consequence the other
three do not:** Arcade evaluates auth requirements *before* `/pre`, so a refusal there fires
no hook, writes no audit row, and shows nothing on the panel (measured, spike #2). Never
stage a beat we want to *show* as a layer-2 refusal. See open risk 2.

## The four acts

| # | Beat | Control | Mechanism |
|---|------|---------|-----------|
| 1 | Sam (analyst) literally cannot see `approve_loan` | Access | `POST /access` → `deny` list |
| 2 | Dana's $95K exceeds her $50K authority → blocked → routed approval → retry succeeds | Pre | `POST /pre` → `CHECK_FAILED` + remediation message |
| 3 | `get_loan` returns a bank account number → redacted before it reaches the model | Post | `POST /post` → `override.output` |
| 4 | Seeded underwriter note contains an injected instruction → stripped | Post | `POST /post` → regex scanner |

## Decisions

| Area | Decision |
|---|---|
| Format | Live demo, but `main` is a forkable template |
| Topology | Arcade Cloud engine → hooks deployed at a stable public URL. No tunnels. |
| Integration | Mastra `MCPClient` → `https://api.arcade.dev/mcp/{gateway}` |
| Model | Claude Sonnet 5 via `@ai-sdk/anthropic`, temperature 0, model id from env |
| **Tool layer** | **Both toolkits are Python `arcade-mcp`, shipped with `arcade deploy` into one Arcade project and exposed through one gateway. `arcade-mcp` is the tool-authoring framework; it is Python-only, which is why the TS-everywhere rule does not reach the toolkits. Decided on #32, confirmed in session.** |
| **Business system** | **`apps/loan-app` is a plain HTTP API — the bank's system of record. It is not an MCP server and knows nothing about Arcade. `tools/loan` is a stateless client of it. Decided on #32; splitting them is what makes "governance is outside the business system" literal rather than asserted.** |
| **Identity** | **Every persona is a real Arcade account with a real email. The persona switcher selects which Arcade user the agent acts as. `context.user_id` on every hook payload is that email.** |
| **Authorization** | **The loan tools require OAuth against our own provider, so they call `apps/loan-app` on behalf of the user rather than as a service account. The API derives the actor from the token, never from a parameter. OAuth carries *identity*; hooks carry *authority*. Provider is Better Auth in its own service, `apps/idp` (#36).** |
| **One identity, not two** | **The Arcade `user_id`, the OAuth subject, and the actor `apps/loan-app` records are the same person, joined on email. If these ever diverge, `governance.db` and `loans.db` describe different people and the audit trail is fiction.** |
| Policy source | Policy DB owned by the hook server. Editable live on stage. |
| HITL | Custom `request_approval` tool posts Block Kit to Slack; approval link carries **no authority** |
| Approval authz | `approvals.decide` is itself a governed tool call — pre-hook enforces role, limit, and requester ≠ approver |
| Approver routing | Deterministic minimum-sufficient-clearance, requester excluded. The LLM does not choose the approver. |
| The wait | Agent ends its turn; SSE `approval.granted` event auto-resumes it |
| Determinism | The **hook** writes the remediation instruction, not the system prompt |
| Redaction | Declarative per-tool field rules + regex over free text |
| Database | `bun:sqlite`, three files: `loans.db` (domain), `governance.db` (policy + audit), `idp.db` (people) |
| Durability | Data persists; resetting is something you deliberately run. Both databases sit on Render disks and seed from their fixture only when empty. Reset is a script (#23), never a redeploy. Decided on #29 |
| Visualization | Hook server → SSE → live three-lane Access/Pre/Post panel |
| Design | Left half deliberately boring enterprise app; right half Arcade-branded control plane |
| **Hosting** | **Render (`render.yaml` blueprint) for `web`, `hooks`, `loan-app`, `idp`. `arcade deploy` for `tools/loan` and `tools/approvals`.** |
| **Languages** | **TypeScript for the three Render services and everything under `packages/`. Python for both `arcade-mcp` toolkits. The boundary is *tool authoring*, not *domain*.** |

## Services

    apps/web         Next.js — chat, persona switcher, approval page, control-plane panel.
                     Mastra agent runs in route handlers. → Render
    apps/hooks       Bun — /access /pre /post, policy engine, audit, SSE. Owns governance.db. → Render
    apps/loan-app    Bun — plain HTTP API, the bank's system of record. Owns loans.db.
                     No MCP, no Arcade, no governance. → Render
    apps/idp         Bun — Better Auth OAuth 2.1 provider, login and consent pages.
                     Owns idp.db. Stands in for the enterprise IdP. → Render

    tools/loan       Python arcade-mcp — search_loans, get_loan, approve_loan, deny_loan.
                     Stateless client of apps/loan-app. → arcade deploy
    tools/approvals  Python arcade-mcp — request_approval, decide. → arcade deploy

    packages/governance-core    Hook framework, policy engine, audit, event bus. Zero loan references.
    packages/policy-schema      Shared zod types for policy, events, hook payloads.

⚠️ **`apps/idp` is not a workspace member and needs its own install.** Better Auth 1.7
requires zod 4; the root manifest pins every workspace to zod 3 for the Arcade/Mastra path,
and Bun applies root overrides across the whole workspace while ignoring nested ones. So
`apps/idp` is excluded from `workspaces`, carries its own `bun.lock`, and a fresh clone needs
**two** installs:

    bun install
    bun install --cwd apps/idp     # or `bun test` fails with "Cannot find module better-auth"

That is a happy accident as much as a workaround — the service a forker deletes is also the
one depending on nothing in the template, and it carries `"cg": { "external": true }` so
`policy-schema`'s workspace sweep leaves it alone. But the second install is a real trap: a
clone-and-run comes up looking broken. It belongs in the README (#24) and in the rehearsal
runbook (#23).

`apps/hooks` and `apps/loan-app` stay separate processes on purpose: one is the governed
system, the other is the thing governing it. Forking means replacing `apps/loan-app`,
`tools/loan` and the seed data, and touching nothing under `packages/`.

That boundary is enforced by tests, not comments. `apps/loan-app` declares
`"cg": { "governed": true }` in its manifest; `knows-nothing-about-governance.test.ts`
fails if governance vocabulary or a `@cg/*` import appears in its source, and
`policy-schema`'s workspace sweep exempts flagged workspaces rather than forcing the
dependency in. Both halves read the same flag so they cannot drift apart. Decided on #33.

## Identity and OAuth

The call chain, end to end:

    Dana (persona switcher)
      → Mastra MCPClient → https://api.arcade.dev/mcp/{gateway}   as Arcade user dana@…
        → /access   hooks see user_id = dana@…            ← layer 1
        → auth requirement: does Dana hold a token?        ← layer 2 (no hook fires)
        → /pre      hooks see user_id = dana@…            ← layer 3
          → tools/loan (arcade deploy) receives Dana's OAuth token
            → apps/loan-app validates it, actor = dana@…
        → /post     hooks rewrite the output               ← layer 4

Three rules this has to hold to:

1. **`apps/loan-app` derives the actor from the token, never from a request parameter.**
   An actor passed as an argument is an actor the model can forge, and act 4 is
   specifically about the model trying to.
2. **Scopes are not the governance gate.** A layer-2 refusal is invisible to the control
   plane. Every beat we intend to *show* is an `/access` or `/pre` decision.
3. **Email is the join key.** Arcade `user_id`, OAuth subject, and `loans.db`'s actor
   column are the same string.

**The provider is its own service: `apps/idp` (#36).** Better Auth
(`@better-auth/oauth-provider`) on Bun, owning `idp.db`, serving a login page and a consent
page. It is a demo fixture standing in for the enterprise's real IdP — the same category of
thing as the persona switcher — and a forker deletes it and points at their Okta.

Folding it into `apps/web` was cheaper but would make our own demo UI the bank's IdP and
the agent's host the token issuer; an enterprise audience asks whether `apps/web` could
just mint itself a token, and the answer would be yes. Folding it into `apps/loan-app` was
ruled out: the boundary test greps that service's source for `role`, `permission`,
`authority` and `limit`, Better Auth's own vocabulary trips it, and loosening that test to
fit auth is the erosion it exists to prevent.

Arcade is an OAuth *client* here: it needs a client id and secret, an authorize URL, a
token URL, and its own generated redirect URI allowlisted on our side. It does not consume
OIDC discovery — endpoints are configured explicitly. It extracts the user's identity from
`/oauth2/userinfo` via a JSONPath expression, **which is what turns rule 3 from a
convention into a mechanism**.

⚠️ **Resetting `idp.db` rotates the OAuth client credentials and silently breaks the
registration held in Arcade** — and it breaks it at the authorize step, which fires no hook,
so the panel stays dark and nothing on screen explains why. The reset must leave the OAuth
client alone. Owned by #36, stated in #23's runbook.

## Tool surface

**loan** (Python, `arcade deploy`)
- `search_loans(status?, min_amount?, max_amount?)`
- `get_loan(loan_id)` → includes `bank_account_number`, `tax_id`, `underwriter_notes`
- `approve_loan(loan_id, amount)`
- `deny_loan(loan_id, reason)`

**approvals** (Python, `arcade deploy`)
- `request_approval(action, resource_id, amount, justification)` — routes deterministically, posts Block Kit
- `decide(request_id, decision, note?)` — called from the approval page as the clicker

⚠️ **Neither toolkit's name has been observed yet.** `arcade deploy` derives it from the
package, but whether it is the raw package name or a normalised form is unmeasured — spike
#2 found that Remote MCP registration applies an aggressive normalisation (lowercase, strip
every `mcp`/`server` substring, PascalCase) and that a hyphenated segment cannot form a
parseable tool name at all. A policy rule keyed on the wrong toolkit matches nothing, which
is indistinguishable from a rule that permits. **Read both names off a real `/pre` payload
and pin them in `.env.example` before #7 writes a rule.** Tracked on #35.

## Cast (emails to be confirmed)

| Persona | Role | Limit | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Dana Okafor | Loan Officer | $50,000 | The protagonist |
| Sam Reyes | Credit Analyst | $0 | `approve_loan` hidden entirely — act 1 |
| Riley Chen | VP Credit | $250,000 | Minimum-sufficient approver for $95K |
| Morgan Ellis | Chief Credit Officer | $5,000,000 | Deliberately *not* bothered — proves routing |

Each persona needs an Arcade account and an account in the OAuth provider, under the same
email.

Seed loan `LN-2291`, Northwind Bakery LLC, $95,000. Carries `bank_account_number` and
`tax_id` (act 3) and an `underwriter_notes` field containing an injected instruction (act 4).

## Event contract

    { id, ts, execution_id, hook: 'access'|'pre'|'post',
      user_id, tool, decision: 'allow'|'deny'|'modify',
      reason, rule_id, before?, after? }

## Open risks

1. ~~**Do contextual-access hooks fire for tools served by a registered Remote MCP
   server?**~~ **Resolved twice over.** Measured yes for Remote MCP servers and for hosted
   toolkits — `docs/spikes/02-remote-mcp-hooks.md` (#2), with raw payloads. Confirmed in
   session by Arcade: **hooks apply to all tools regardless of where the server is hosted**,
   including `arcade deploy`'d toolkits, which is the path this demo now runs on. Spike #2
   remains valid and is now documentation of a capability the live demo no longer exercises,
   since nothing here is registered as a Remote MCP server.

2. **Layer-2 refusals are invisible to the control plane.** Measured, spike #2: an unmet
   auth requirement returns `tool_requirements_not_met` and no hook fires — no `/pre` event,
   no audit row, nothing on the panel. Not an architectural problem, but it constrains two
   slices: **#14/#21** must not stage a beat as an auth failure, and **#12**'s audit schema
   cannot claim `governance.db` is a complete record of refusals. Worth a line in the panel
   naming the layer that refuses upstream of the hooks.

3. **Toolkit names are unmeasured.** See **Tool surface**. Tracked on #35, blocks #7.

4. **Identity could silently split.** Arcade `user_id` and the OAuth subject must be the
   same email. Arcade's JSONPath extraction from `/oauth2/userinfo` gives this a mechanism
   (#36, configured on #13) — but nothing verifies that a persona's Arcade account and their
   `idp.db` row were created with the same address. If they drift, the pre-hook governs one
   person while the loan book records another, and every test still passes.

5. ~~**Does Arcade's stock Slack provider grant a user token with `chat:write`?**~~
   *Answered: yes — `docs/spikes/03-slack-scopes.md` (#3). Act 2 posts as the requester.
   The tool must request four scopes, not three: `users:read` is a prerequisite for
   `users:read.email`.*

6. **What survives a hook denial over MCP?** `@arcadeai/arcadejs` exposes `execution_id` and
   typed `CONTEXT_CHECK_FAILED` / `CONTEXT_DENIED` errors, but over MCP those flatten toward
   `isError: true` + text. Resolved for our purposes by the hook-embedded correlation token
   (#6); noted here because it shapes what the panel can claim.

## Sequence (~2.5 weeks)

1. Spikes 1–3. **Done.**
2. Scaffold, policy schema, loan book. **Done** (#4, #5, #11).
3. Split into `apps/loan-app` + `tools/loan`; measure the toolkit names (#34, #35).
   In parallel: `apps/idp` (#36).
4. Arcade wiring: gateway, hook extension, OAuth provider (#13).
5. Thinnest vertical slice, end to end and ugly: agent → gateway → tool → API, one denying
   pre-hook (#14).
6. Acts 1, 3, 4 — access hook, redaction, injection.
7. Approvals: Slack, approval page, `decide` as a governed call, auto-resume.
8. Control-plane panel and the split-screen UI.
9. Rehearsal, reset script, README for forkers.
