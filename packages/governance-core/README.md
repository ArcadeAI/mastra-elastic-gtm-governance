# @cg/governance-core

The governance layer: hook framework, policy engine, redaction, audit, event bus. Free of
business-domain vocabulary and — enforced by `test/no-app-dependencies.test.ts` — of any
dependency on `apps/*`. Forking means replacing the governed app and touching nothing here.

## PolicyEngine (`src/policy-engine.ts`, #7)

Pure. No I/O, no clock, no randomness. Two questions:

```ts
import { compilePolicy, resolveVisibility, evaluatePermission } from "@cg/governance-core";

const policy = compilePolicy({
  // Every governed toolkit (the ARCADE_*_TOOLKIT values from config, never
  // hardcoded), the tools it serves, and the arguments each call must supply.
  // Required: it is the typo check at compile time, the fail-closed boundary
  // at runtime, and what lets the compiler check remediation instructions.
  // A trailing `?` marks an argument optional: not required on the call, usable
  // in conditions, not usable as a {{inputs.…}} placeholder.
  catalogue: {
    [toolkitName]: {
      search_widgets: ["status?", "min_quantity?", "max_quantity?"],
      get_widget: ["widget_id"],
      update_widget: ["widget_id", "quantity"],
    },
    Approvals: { request_approval: ["resource_id", "quantity", "justification"] },
  },
  rules,   // PolicyRule[] from governance.db
});

// /access — which tools may this subject see at all
resolveVisibility(subject, tools, policy);   // → { tool, decision }[]

// /pre — may this subject make *this* call, with *these* argument values
evaluatePermission({ subject, tool, inputs, policy, grants });   // → Decision
```

`subject` is `Subject | null` — the hook handler (#12) resolves `context.user_id` to a
`Subject`; `null` means nobody matched. `grants` are `ValidatedGrant`s: grants that #10's
`GrantChecker` has judged valid *for this call* (expiry, uses, approver ≠ subject,
`resource_id`, pinned inputs, ceiling against the call's own value) and marked so with
`attestGrantValidated`. That function is the only way to produce the type, so a grant cannot
reach the engine without passing through validation. The engine itself only checks that a
grant applies to this subject and tool.

### What a decision means

| Situation | `effect` | `rule_id` |
|---|---|---|
| A rule matched | the rule's | the rule's id |
| A `pre` rule would deny, but an applicable grant is present | `allow` | the rule the grant lifted |
| A catalogued tool that no rule speaks about | `allow` | `null` |
| Unknown subject | `deny` | `null` |
| Toolkit not in the catalogue | `deny` | `null` |
| Tool not in its toolkit's catalogue entry (typo, case, prefix, or a tool the policy never heard of) | `deny` | `null` |
| A `/pre` call missing a catalogued argument of its tool | `deny` | `null` |
| A rule's condition reads an input that is missing or of the wrong type | `deny` | that rule's id |

Rules are evaluated in ascending `priority`, ties broken by `id`; first match wins.
Disabled rules never fire.

### Why `compilePolicy` throws

A rule that matches nothing is indistinguishable at runtime from a rule that permits. So
compilation is loud: it refuses, with every problem listed, a rule whose toolkit or tool the
catalogue does not list, whose condition reads an input no matched tool accepts (a typo
there would fail closed forever, telling the model to set an input the tool does not take),
whose condition value makes no sense for its operator (`gt "10"`, `in "eu"`, an invalid
regex), an `exists: false` on a required argument (dead: the call is denied before any rule
runs), a subject matcher that can never match (empty `roles` or `user_ids`,
`clearance_below <= 0`, an empty clearance band), an `access` rule with conditions (there are
no inputs at `/access`), a `modify` effect, a duplicate id, a `reason` placeholder rooted
outside `inputs`, `subject` or `tool` — and a `pre` denial whose reason is not actionable
(below).

**The one loudness gap, stated.** The engine holds no roster, so a misspelled *role* or
*user id* in `subjects` cannot be caught at compile time: such a rule matches nobody and the
default allow applies. The guarantee covers `match`, `conditions` and everything the schema
makes provable; role and user-id spelling is #12's seed data's to get right.

### Denial reasons

Over MCP the model sees `"Tool execution was denied by an extension policy: " + reason`
and nothing else. A rule's `reason` should therefore name the next tool to call and the
arguments it needs, and may interpolate the call:

```
DENIED: {{inputs.quantity}} exceeds your {{subject.clearance}} clearance.
To proceed, call Approvals.request_approval with resource_id={{inputs.widget_id}},
quantity={{inputs.quantity}} and justification=<why>, then retry this call unchanged.
```

Placeholders are exactly two segments and every one is provable at compile time:
`{{inputs.<argument>}}` where the argument is catalogued for *every* tool the rule can match
(the engine requires those inputs on the call, so the value is always there),
`{{subject.user_id|display_name|role|clearance}}`, and `{{tool.toolkit|name}}`. A placeholder
the engine cannot guarantee to fill is a compile error, not a `(not provided)` at runtime, and
so is any `{{` or `}}` that does not form a placeholder — `{{}}` included.

**This is enforced, not advised.** A `pre` rule with `effect: deny` fails to compile unless
its `reason` either contains the words `Do not retry`, which tells the model to stop rather
than guess (and then instructs no call at all), or names a catalogued tool as `Toolkit.tool`
*and*, after that name, spells out as `name=value` every argument the catalogue lists for
that tool. The reason is read as one left-to-right token stream. Arguments belong to the
`Toolkit.tool` reference they follow, and *any* such reference closes the previous one,
catalogued or not, so arguments cannot drift onto a tool that was not named for them;
arguments given to an uncatalogued reference are refused. The value is a `{{inputs.…}}`
placeholder, a `<what to supply>` instruction, a non-empty quoted string or a bare literal
with no brace, angle or quote characters; `name=` with nothing usable after it is refused,
and so is an argument the tool does not accept. So `"Insufficient authority."` is refused as
an apology, `"…with banana=1."` for the unknown argument, `"…with resource_id=, quantity=,
justification=."` and `"…resource_id={{}}, …"` for the missing values, two tools with
swapped argument lists for both, and `"Call Approvals.request_approval; then
Bogus.do_thing with resource_id=…"` because the arguments follow a tool that does not exist. Access denials are exempt: they hide
the tool, and the model never reads them.

Engine-authored reasons (the fail-closed rows above) follow the same standard: they name the
tool and input, and say whether a retry can fix it.

### Conditions

All conditions on a rule must hold. `input` is a dot path into the call's inputs.

| operator | value | fires when |
|---|---|---|
| `eq` / `neq` | any | input equals / differs from value (structural) |
| `gt` `gte` `lt` `lte` | number | numeric comparison |
| `in` / `nin` | array | input is / is not a member |
| `matches` | regex source | input is a string matching it |
| `exists` | omitted or `true` | input is present and not `null` |
| `exists` | `false` | input is absent or `null` |
| `exceeds_clearance` | none | input is a number greater than `subject.clearance` |

Numbers are not coerced: `"95"` is malformed, not ninety-five, and the denial says so and
asks for a number. The limit itself is inclusive — exactly at clearance is allowed.
