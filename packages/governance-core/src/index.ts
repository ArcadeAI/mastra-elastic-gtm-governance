/**
 * The governance layer: hook framework, policy engine, redaction, audit,
 * event bus. Deliberately free of any business-domain vocabulary, and —
 * enforced by `test/no-app-dependencies.test.ts` — of any dependency on
 * `apps/*`. Swapping the domain means replacing the governed app, never
 * touching this.
 *
 * The types live one layer down in `@cg/policy-schema` (#5) so that the apps,
 * the UI and this package all agree on one definition. Re-exported here for
 * convenience; `@cg/policy-schema` remains the single source.
 *
 * The four pure modules: #7 (PolicyEngine, `./policy-engine.ts`), #8
 * (RedactionEngine), #9 (ApproverRouter, `./approver-router.ts`) and #10
 * (GrantChecker).
